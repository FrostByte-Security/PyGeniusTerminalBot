# PyGeniusTerminalBot
ChatGPT in your Command Terminal!

I made this code because I was sick and tired of ChatGPT erasing my valuable conversations!

1) Make a folder and save the script in the folder.
2) Go to your ChatGPT account and find your API key and replace it under 
3) Open up your command prompt and run 'python pygenius_terminalbot.py'
4) Chat with ChatGPT!

Now after you type 'exit' the script will terminate and save your entire conversation as a .txt file in the same folder the script is in!

I am editing the script to ask what you want to name the conversation text file before the code is terminated so it does not overwrite the previous conversation.
